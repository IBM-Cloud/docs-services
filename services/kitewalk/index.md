# Getting started with Kitewalk GEO Web Services
{: #gettingstarted_kitewalk}

Kitewalk GEO Web Services for Bluemix add geo-intelligence features to your apps ("around me" functionalities). Using Kitewalk, your apps can set and get contents of any nature both timely and spatially. Ultimately, Kitewalk will allow to retrieve lists of dynamic geo-contents within distance, time and category of interest constraints around any GPS position.

A [diagram](https://kitewalk.com/img/ws-api.jpg){:new_window} which describes graphically the objects which can be created and manipulated via Kitewalk GEO Web Services can be found [here](https://kitewalk.com/img/ws-api.jpg){:new_window}. Additionally, a helper article has been published in the [IBM Bluemix blog](
https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2017/07/what-is-a-geo-intelligent-communication-platform-kitewalk-explains/){:new_window}. 
 
Kitewalk technology and its use cases are described in [this video](https://youtu.be/ll3GT-sRwB0){:new_window}. Before an application developer can embed Kitewalk capabilities into an app, the administrator will need to specify its Kitewalk API Id and its Kitewalk API Key inside the Bluemix user interface.

To integrate your app with Kitewalk GEO Web Services, complete these steps:

1. Registration to Kitewalk GEO Web Services -> follow the instructions included in our [First Steps Guide](http://api.kitewalk.com#first-login){:new_window}.
2. Initial tests of Kitewalk GEO Web Services-> follow the instructions included in our [First Tests Guide](http://api.kitewalk.com#first-tests){:new_window}.

	```
        Testing the services is free. A sandbox API ID and API KEY
        are provided for such purpose. The sandbox site ws.kitewalk.com
        also helps developers to debug / inspect API calls.
	```
	{: codeblock}

3. After the services are mastered in the sandbox/testing environment, a production (API ID, API KEY) couple can be requested from Kitewalk at any time. Such production keys will allow the use of Kitewalk GEO Web Services in a fully independent single-tenant environment which can be fully customized to meet the customer requirements in terms of categories of contents, time and distances. The Kitewalk API Id and its Kitewalk API Key inside the Bluemix user interface will need to be updated accordingly.
