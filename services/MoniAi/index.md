Moni.ai allows you to define new ways to interact with your business by defining Voice Channels. A Voice Channel starts with a trigger pattern that Moni listens to. After a user said that trigger pattern you define what happens visually using Node-Red. Doing that you have full control over the process and you can query databases, retrieve relevant information or call APIs and perform tasks.
After defining a Voice Channel you can talk to Moni using the iOS or Android app or using the Moni.ai website.

To design a Voice Channel, complete these steps: 

1. Deploy the Moni.ai Voice Channel designer to Bluemix.
2. Create your Voice Channel using the red Moni.ai nodes.
3. Publish your Voice Channel on the Moni.ai developers page.
