# Getting started with TinyQueries
{: #gettingstarted}

TinyQueries is a SQL query generator service which can be connected to a SQL database running on Bluemix. 
TinyQueries can be used to create fast running SQL queries easily, which can be published as a REST api. 
{:shortdesc}

Before an application developer can create queries or a REST-api, 
the administrator must create an unbound service instance of TinyQueries by using the Bluemix user interface or by the CloudFoundry commandline interface.
You should create a SQL database service as well. Currently we support ClearDB and ElephantSQL.

To get up and running quickly with this service, follow these steps:

1. Clone the init-application:

	```
	git clone https://github.com/wdiesveld/cf-init-tinyqueries
	```
	{: pre}
	
2. If you prefer you can rename the folder cf-init-tinyqueries to your own name.

3. Go to the folder:
	
	```
	cd cf-init-tinyqueries	
	```
	{: pre}

4. Edit the manifest.yml file. Change the 'host' attribute to something unique. Then under "services:" change "my-test-sql-db" to the name of your SQL database service. This is the name of the service that will be bound to your application and thus available to this application. Do the same for "my-test-tinyqueries-project"

5. Push it to CloudFoundry:

	```
	cf push
	```
	{: pre}

6. Go to the TinyQueries dashboard using the Bluemix interface.

7. Click on 'Start creating queries' to go to the query editor - from this interface you can create and publish queries to the app.
