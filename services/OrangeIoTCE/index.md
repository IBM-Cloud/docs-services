# Getting started with Orange IoT Connect Express on Bluemix
{: #gettingstarted}

Orange IoT Connect Express provides a simpler and more efficient way to manage all your SIM cards, personalize their services, carry out remote analysis and reduce your operational costs. Our M2M API enables you to build services that seamlessly integrate all the information provided by your M2M SIM cards, allowing you to manage your SIM fleet in real-time.

<!-- Provide an appropriate ID above -->

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use your service in an app. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include the service long name and "Bluemix". Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.

Examples: -->

IBM Single Sign On is a policy-based authentication service for Bluemix. With Single Sign On, you can easily embed single sign-on capability in Node.js or Liberty for Java apps. -OR-
With IBM IoT Real-Time Insights on Bluemix, you can perform analytics on real-time data from your Internet of Things devices, and gain insights about their health and the overall state of your operations.  -OR-
Use IBM BigInsights for Apache Hadoop for Bluemix to provision enterprise-scale, multi-node big data clusters on the IBM SoftLayer cloud. After they are provisioned, you can manage and access these clusters from the BigInsights service.

<!-- If overview content is required, do not include it here. Put it in a separate "## About" section below the task section. -->

<!-- Task section: REQUIRED
The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app. 
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service. 
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->

Before an application developer can embed single sign-on capability into an app, the administrator must create unbound service instances by using the Bluemix user interface.

<!-- Include a sentence to briefly introduce the steps. Examples: -->

To integrate your app with the service, complete these steps: -OR-
To get up and running quickly with this service, follow these steps: -OR-
Complete these steps to get started with the BigInsights service:

<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. For code examples: 
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.
 -->

1. Step 1 to integrate app with the service.
2. Step 2 to integrate app with the service.

	```
	Copyable example for this step. 
	This example might be multiline code
	to copy into a file. 
	When displayed in the doc framework, 
	it will have a copy button on the right.
	The user can click to copy the example 
	so they can paste it into their code editor.
	```
	{: codeblock}

3. Step 3. In this step, we have a single line command example. When displayed by the doc framework, it will have a $ shown at the beginning of the line, and a copy button on the right. The copy button will copy the command but not the $.

	```
	my command -and -options
	```
	{: pre}

4. Step 4
	```
	This is a bunch of output from
		a command or program I ran
			and it can run lots of lines
			and the doc framework will show it as 
			output with no copy button.
	```
	{: screen}



<!-- Related links section: REQUIRED.
Related links display in the upper right of the getting started page. 
Ensure that you retain the lowercase anchor IDs (eg. {: #rellinks}) as shown in this template. These are used as IDs during transform and the doc framework keys off the IDs for display. 
The headings coded here are not actually used. The doc framework provides the correct headings. 
Also ensure that the related links stay in position at the end of this file or the doc framework will not display them properly.
